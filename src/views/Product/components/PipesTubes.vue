        </div>
        <div class="text">Pipes and tubes are cylindrical structures that areused to transpor fluids and gases. They are
          classified based on their shape, size, and material. Some common classifications include seamless, welded,
          and spiral welded.</div>

          <div class="title" style="line-height: 1;margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 4rem;">CLASSIFICATION</div>
          <div>BNG provides seamless pipes which are made from a single piece of metal and have no welds or
            joints.They are known for their high strength and durability. Welded pipeson the other hand, are made by
            welding
            two or more pieces of metal together. They are less expensive than seamless pipes but are not as strong.
            Spiral
            welded pipes are made by winding a strip of metal into a spiral shape, and then welding the edges together.
            They
            are used for large-diameter pipe applications.</div>

          <div class="title" style="line-height: 1;margin-bottom: .5rem; font-size: 4rem;">SIZE</div>
          <div>BNG serves a wide range of size ranges for pipes and tubes vary depending on the application.
            For example, small-diameter pipes are used for plumbing and irrigation, while large-diameter pipes are used
            for gas and oil transportation. The dimensions of pipes and tubes are typically measured by their outer
            diameter (OD) and wall thickness.</div>
