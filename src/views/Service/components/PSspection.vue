          1. PRE-PRODUCTION INSPECTION
        </p>
        <div>
          Preproduction inspection is a crucial step that occurs before the
          start of the manufacturing process. It serves to determine the
          readiness of the factory and assess the quality of procured raw
          materials for production. This inspection involves two key components:
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Material inspection, which focuses on evaluating the quality of
          the acquired materials.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Production process overview and management, which involves
          assessing the overall production process and ensuring effective
          management practices are in place.
        </div>
        <p class="weight" style="margin: 0 0; font-size: 1.5rem">
          2. PROGRESSIVE PRODUCTION INSPECTION
        </p>
        <div>
          This inspection, conducted while manufacturing is in progress, plays a
          crucial role in identifying and rectifying defects and quality issues
          before the production process is completed.
        </div>
        <div>This inspection involves several key activities:</div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Visual inspection, which allows for visual assessment of
          product quality.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Mechanical properties testing, which involves evaluating the
          mechanical characteristics of the product.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Dimensions measurement, ensuring that the product meets the
          required specifications.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Monitoring manufacturing parameters such as temperature,
          pressure, time, etc., to ensure they are within the specified ranges.
        </div>
        <p class="weight" style="margin: 0 0; font-size: 1.5rem">
          3. PRE-SHIPMENT INSPECTION
        </p>
        <div>
          Inspectors perform checks during production to verify the
          functionality of products and ensure they meet quality standards
          before shipment.
        </div>
        <div>
          This inspection process involves the following key components:
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Visual inspection, which allows for visual assessment of
          product quality.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="r_box">
      <div class="content">
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Mechanical properties testing: Evaluating the product's
          mechanical characteristics and performance.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Dimensions measurement: Verifying that the product's dimensions
          align with the specified requirements.
        </div>
        <div>
          •&nbsp;Surface finish inspection: Assessing the quality and
          consistency of the product's surface appearance and texture.

          5. CONTAINER LOADING INSPECTION
        </p>
        <div>
          Container loading inspection involves quality officers conducting
          thorough checks to ensure the accurate quantity and quality of goods
          being loaded onto containers. Additionally, they verify the presence
          of proper labels and barcodes on the packaging materials of the
          products. This final run-through significantly reduces the risk of
          transportation damage to the goods.
